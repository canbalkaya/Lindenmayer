## [0.5.0](https://github.com/heckj/Lindenmayer/releases/tag/0.5.0) (2021-12-23)

The initial release of Lindenmayer.

The library supports creating context-free and contextual parametric L-systems. Built-in modules support 2D and basic 3D visualizations, and some reference implementations of previously described L-systems.

The API is by no means finished, complete, or in a final form. There are several places where I'm considering how to make creating L-systems written in the Swift language more ergonomic, and additional features that I want to add for broader support (such as stochastic production rules).

This edition is suitable for experimentation, and I certainly welcome feedback in the [discussion section](https://github.com/heckj/Lindenmayer/discussions) of the [Github repository](https://github.com/heckj/Lindenmayer/).
